# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section

## Welcome!


With this project, I've got the idea of implementing first a grid-container ,
in order to make the webpage responsive. Here, what I have done was just to implement 
all the elements of the webpage (logo, picture, main text and social networks icons) 
in their proper places.
All we have to do is just to create  a <div> container which has for the "display" property, the value of "grid"( display:grid ). 
Voila! And then, we instert the number of rows and columns needed for the design.
For this project, for the desktop design, I have inserted 2 colums and 3 rows. 
For the mobile design,  I have just implemented 1 column and 4 rows.

I have discovered the possibilities we can get with the Grid containers. 
What I like the most is that CSS Grid "focuses on precise content placement."
 And this is very important when designing responsive web-pages. 
Flexbox is nice too especially when we have to design 1-demantional webpages.

For this project for instance, I had to implement some social networks' icons at the 
bottom of the page and these icons do not have the same dimensions. 
The other issues I faced are that I had to find a way to change the background-color of 
those icons and these icons had to be placed at the bottom right of the webpage. 
Concerning this latter, I resovlved the problem by using the "float" property float: right. 
I had also to reduce the space between these icons. For that, I defined a smaller margin for the desktop's
design of the webpage and defined margin:0 for the mobile's design.
To change the color of these social networks' icons, I had to use codes provided by Fontsawesome when I downloaded these icons.
First there was a code to implement in the HTML page and in the "main.css" page, I have to style these icons by implementing classes 
still provided by the same website. This how I resolved this issue.
