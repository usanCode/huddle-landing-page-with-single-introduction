# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section



## Welcome!


With this project, I've got the idea of implementing first a grid-container ,
in order to make the webpage responsive. Here, what I have done was just to implement 
all the elements of the webpage (logo, picture, main text and social networks icons) 
in their proper places.
All we have to do is just to create  a <div> container which has for the "display" property, the value of "grid"( display:grid ). 
Voila! And then, we instert the number of rows and columns needed for the design.
For this project, for the desktop design, I have inserted 2 colums and 3 rows. 
For the mobile design,  I have just implemented 1 column and 4 rows.
